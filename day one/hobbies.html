    <p>I love listening to music, especially when I have to focus for some time. It help me concentrate and my thoughts seem to become endless.</p>
    
    <p>What can I say about this particular hobby of mine. I've always had a thing for shinny things, and so begins my journey for making my own jewelry.</p>
    
    <p>Ah, yes, traveling....it is one of my <strong><em>greatest things</em></strong> to do when the time comes with my husband. We want to go abroad to see the other side of this world. One day very soon, I pray.</p>
    
    <p>Last, but surely not least....programming. I've always had this pull on me to work in the tech industry, however, so many naysayers including my own teachers were never very encouraging. It wasn't until my husband showed me overwhelming support that I decided to take the leap.</p>
